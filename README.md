# CodingDojo_Flask_Form
Flask application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page.

Practice adding routes to a Flask app, having the client send data to the server with a form, and have the server render a template using data provided by the client.

1. http://localhost:5000 - have this display a nice looking HTML form.  The form should be submitted to '/result'
2. http://localhost:5000/result - have this display a html with the information that was submitted by POST
